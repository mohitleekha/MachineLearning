As part of this project i am exploring various machine learning algorigthms of different Categories. Below are environment details at the time of development
1.) Window 10 Machine
2.) Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda
3.) Python3

Starting With Binary Classification algorithms, I explored the accuracy of different algorithms in(PredictDiabetes_BinaryClassification.py) on a dataset(pima-indians-diabetes.csv). Logistic_regression provide the highest accuracy for the dataset. Also BinaryClassificationAlgoSelection.webp includes the generic rule for choosing a classification algorithm
